# Emberfall: Last Light — Godot rebuild

This is the Godot-side counterpart to the Web prototype in `src/` at the
repo root. Full context — what exists in the Web build, what should be
kept/improved/rebuilt, the recommended architecture, and the complete
12-step build order this project is following — lives in
[`GODOT_MIGRATION.md`](../GODOT_MIGRATION.md) at the repo root. Read that
first; this file only tracks what's actually been built here so far.

## Status: build-order step 6 of 12 — level generation

**Important caveat:** this project was authored without access to the
Godot editor or engine binary — this environment doesn't have Godot
installed, so most of it has not been opened, run, or validated by the
actual engine. **Steps 1-5 have been confirmed working** by the user
running them in their own Godot editor, including live debugging of three
real issues this session surfaced and fixed (a null-guard gap in
`weapon()`/`ability()`, a debug-label layout overlap, and a duplicate
`combo_step` field GDScript rejects that TypeScript silently allows).
**Step 6 below has NOT yet had that same live confirmation** — and it is
by a wide margin the largest, most architecturally novel step so far
(procedural generation, a whole new room-persistence model, real physics
walls). Treat it as unverified until you run it and report back, and
expect a real chance something needs a fix. If anything fails to parse or
run, report the exact error.

### Steps 1-5 — scaffold, data, core entities, combat+AI, weapons (confirmed working)

5 Autoloads, 80 `.tres` Resource files across 10 content categories,
Player/Enemy/Boss as `CharacterBody2D` entities with real movement/
stamina/dodge/cooldown gating, the full damage pipeline (melee arc,
projectiles, contact damage, warden bash, bloat detonation), all 6 enemy
AI behavior families, the generic status-effect runtime, and a real
`WeaponBehavior` Strategy split so ranged weapons actually fire. Full
detail in git history — see the step-1 through step-5 commits, or
`GODOT_MIGRATION.md` for the architecture.

### Step 6 — level generation: real rooms, walls, and bidirectional stairs (just added, unverified)

The point of this step per `GODOT_MIGRATION.md` §5: port `LevelGenerator.ts`
and get a full run genuinely navigable start-to-boss-and-back, with the
*bidirectional* stairs (retreat to the previous zone) working from day
one rather than bolted on later. Every generated room is a real,
permanent `RoomContainer` node — created once, never freed or
regenerated; only the one the player is standing in is ever visible or
simulating (see `world/room_container.gd`'s own header for exactly why,
and how that's enforced beyond just hiding it).

| File | Ports | State |
|---|---|---|
| `world/room_container.gd` | `world/Room.ts` | Room data + real wall geometry: `StaticBody2D` segments built from `get_walls(locked)`, rebuilt the instant a room clears so the door physically opens. `set_active()` is the room-persistence mechanism — see its own comment |
| `world/level_generator.gd` | `world/LevelGenerator.ts` | The full generator: the frontier-growth room graph, the elite/shop/chest/sanctum/event/rest type budget, obstacle scatter (door-lane and landmark clearance included), stairs placement, the Ruins/Citadel encounter-template composition, the mutated-variant roll, the sanctum wave spawner, and the luck-biased rarity roll |
| `world/obstacle_node.gd`, `chest_node.gd`, `pickup_node.gd` | `Obstacle.ts`, `Chest.ts`, `Pickup.ts` | New entity types — obstacles are real `StaticBody2D`s (move_and_slide blocks against them for free, exactly like it already does for nothing before this step); chests and pickups are plain `Node2D`s, proximity-driven like the source |
| `autoload/level_flow.gd` | The room/zone-flow half of `core/Game.ts` | New autoload: door crossing, room-clear detection, the sanctum rite, resting, opening a chest, and the full scripted stairs transition (walk in → zone switch → walk out), both directions |
| `autoload/run_state.gd` | `progression/RunState.ts` | `advance_zone()`/`retreat_zone()`/`move_through_door()` are real now — all 3 zones generate up front at run start and stay resident for the whole run, so retreating mid-fight and coming back finds survivors exactly where they were |
| `entities/projectile.gd` | `resolveProjectileWalls` + the obstacle-blocking half of `updateProjectiles` | Bolts now actually stop at a wall or a `blocksProjectiles` obstacle instead of sailing through |
| `entities/player.gd` | — | New **E** interact key; a `is_transitioning` flag suppresses input during the scripted stairs walk |

**Deferred this pass, on purpose:** the actual reward-*granting* UI (the
3-choice upgrade pick on a cleared room, a chest's single upgrade) needs
the upgrade-ownership system, which is real UI — step 9. Every reward
*beat* still plays out (a cleared heart room's stairs unseal, a chest
plays its open animation, the sanctum rite heals 30% and pays 35 embers)
except the upgrade choice itself, which prints to the Output panel instead
of silently doing nothing. Shop and event landmarks spawn and are
walkable-up-to, but pressing E on either just prints that it needs step
9's real UI. Kill rewards that *don't* need new UI — XP (already-working
`RunState.grant_xp`) and Ember pickups — are fully wired.

`scenes/main/main.gd` no longer spawns the fixed one-of-each-behavior
playground — it boots a real run via `LevelFlow.start_new_run()` with a
fresh random seed each launch (shown nowhere yet but reproducible within
one engine session; see `GODOT_MIGRATION.md` §6 on why a seed isn't
expected to reproduce the Web build's own layouts). The live debug panel
now also shows the current room (type/locked/cleared/doors/enemy count),
zone/embers/level/XP, and the current interact prompt.

**How to test it:** run the project. You should land in an empty starting
room — walk to any door-shaped gap in the wall and cross it; you should
land in the next room with the camera/player continuous (no jarring
teleport look, though it technically is one). Find a **combat** room
(locked — walls should look sealed across every door until you clear it):
kill everything and confirm the walls covering the doors disappear and
the Output panel prints a "cleared" line. Find the **chest** room, walk
up to it and press **E** — it should visibly open and print its tier.
Find the **rest** room and press E at the brazier — your HP should jump
up. If Level 1 (Ashen Woods) has a **sanctum** room, kneel at its circle
(E) and fight through 3 waves — doors should stay sealed throughout, then
unseal with a heal + embers on completion. Clear the zone's **heart**
room and its stairwell should visibly unseal — walk up and press E to
descend: watch the short walk-in/fade/walk-out, land in the next zone's
start room next to an *up* stairwell, then immediately press E there to
ascend back — you should land back in the heart room you just cleared,
by the same stairs, and it should still show `cleared=true` with the same
enemies gone. None of this has been confirmed working yet — report
exactly what you see, especially anything about doors not sealing/
unsealing correctly, walls that seem to block or fail to block movement
oddly, or an error in the Output panel (parse errors will likely show up
immediately on load, the same way `combo_step` did last step).

### Next steps (not started)

Per `GODOT_MIGRATION.md` §5, step 7: real rendering — `_draw()` ports (or
authored sprites) replacing every flat-colored placeholder circle/rect,
and `PointLight2D` sources wherever the current code calls `lighting.add(...)`.
